\title{Rebuild Rust Extension and Reload Package}
\usage{
rebuild()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Called for its side effects.
}
\description{
A utility function for development that reloads the current R package
and regenerates Rust extension bindings using \code{rextendr}.
}
\details{
This function is intended to speed up development when working on an
R package that includes Rust code via \code{{rextendr}}. It first calls
\code{devtools::load_all()} to reload the package, then runs
\code{rextendr::document()} to re-generate bindings to Rust functions
and update any necessary wrappers or documentation.

This is typically used after modifying Rust source files or when
iterating on Rustâ†”R interop code.
