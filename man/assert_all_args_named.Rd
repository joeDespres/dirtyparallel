\title{Assert That All Arguments Are Named}
\usage{
assert_all_args_named()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL} if all arguments are named. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
}
\description{
Throws an error if any argument passed to the current function is not named.
This is designed for use in contexts where strict argument naming is required,
such as experimental or unsafe parallel processing.
}
\details{
This assertion is useful in functions that rely on precise, named inputs â€”
especially when doing unconventional things like calling R functions from multiple
Rust threads. Unnamed arguments can introduce ambiguity and unpredictable behavior
in such contexts.

If any argument is unnamed or has an empty name (\code{""}), the function throws
an error with a message explaining the requirement.
