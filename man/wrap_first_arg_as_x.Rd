\title{Rename the First Argument of a Function}
\usage{
wrap_first_arg_as_x(fn)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn}{A function object whose first argument will be renamed.}
}
\value{
The same function with its first formal argument renamed to \code{"x"}.
}
\description{
Utility to rename the first argument of a function to \code{"x"}.
This is mostly a temporary hack to standardize argument names
during development or metaprogramming workflows.
}
\details{
This is intended for internal or experimental use. It directly modifies
the function's formals, which may break things if used carelessly.

Hopefully, we donâ€™t keep this!
